# Traveller Romani adverbs

For now, this file contains not only adverbs (they should stay), 
but also a rest category of things to be moved to their respective
stem files (one file for each part-of-speech).

**LEXICON adv** adds the tag **+Adv**

**LEXICON Adverbs** lists the adverbs themselves (as well as the restcategory, for now)
* alonom adv "aleine" ;

* ifann adv "ifra" ;
* ipali adv "igjen" ;
