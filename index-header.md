There are several Romani languages, and it is at the moment not clear how many standardised Romani languages there are in the Nordic countries. [Here is an overview](../lang-rmy/romani-languages.html).

This page documents the work on the [Traveller Norwegian Romani language model](https://github.com/giellalt/lang-rmg). Some work has been done, based upon Rolf Theil's *Vandriane rakkrar* (Novus forlag 2014).

# Project documentation

* Links to project specific documentation will be added here as needed. 


* The Traveller Norwegian language may be tested as an online speller by writing text [here](https://divvun.org/proofing/online-speller.html) (select Traveller Norwegian).


# In-source documentation
