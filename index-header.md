There are several Romani languages, and it is at the moment not clear how many standardised Romani languages there are in the Nordic countries. [Here is an overview](../lang-rmy/romani-languages.html).

This page documents the work on the [Traveller Norwegian Romani language model](https://github.com/giellalt/lang-rmg). Some work has been done, based upon Rolf Theil's *Vandriane rakkrar* (Novus forlag 2014).
