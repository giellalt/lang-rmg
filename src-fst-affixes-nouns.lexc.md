# Noun inflection
The Traveller Romani language nouns inflect in number and definiteness

**TODO:** The lexica *m1 - m4* may be unified and their inflection 
differences handled in twolc. *f1, f2* and *n* have different suffixes
and should be kept.

**LEXICON mx** for uninflected (for now)

**LEXICON f1m2** split in two

**LEXICON f1m1** split  in two

**LEXICON f** goes to f2

**LEXICON pl** with no gender info

**LEXICON m1** 

**LEXICON m1pl** pl only

**LEXICON m2**

**LEXICON m3**

**LEXICON m4**

**LEXICON f1**

**LEXICON f2**

**LEXICON n**
